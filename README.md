# UpdateSite
Home of the LATEST Update ZIP files from SAFSDEV Releases.

When certain projects like Core or SeleniumPlus create a Release there is usually an Update ZIP 
that is created allowing existing SAFS or SeleniumPlus installations to perform an update of 
those assets deemed important or available for the existing installation.

Existing installations expect a consistent static URL to be able to find and install those updates.

Such updates will be made available via binary ZIP files in this repository until such time as 
GitHub makes individual "assets" in the "latest" Release available via static URLs pointing to 
that latest asset.
